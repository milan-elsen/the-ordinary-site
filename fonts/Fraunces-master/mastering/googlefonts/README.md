# Making PRs to google/fonts for updates

(First, you must set up your build environment. See the main project readme for instructions.)

You can use `mastering/googlefonts/gftools-packager-fraunces.sh` to make PRs to [google/fonts](https://github.com/google/fonts). However, this tool may evolve.

NOTE: You need push access to google/fonts for this tool to work.

Relevant project metadata is listed in `upstream.yaml`. Update this if needed, but tread with caution.

If you do not have push access to google/fonts but you wish to update Fraunces on Google Fonts, please file an issue at [google/fonts](https://github.com/google/fonts), and someone will help figure out what to do.
