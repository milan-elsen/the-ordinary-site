CHAUNCY SPECIMEN IDEAS

	• Web specimen is the Chauncy chatbot. Chauncy mostly gives garbled advice, tells nonsensical jokes, waxes "philosophical", and talks about its appearance.
	• Printed specimen could be "written" by Chauncy. Specimen is overview of top jokes by Chauncey, samples of prose written by Chauncy, advice column (people that have written Chauncy for advice), and visual features of Chauncy.
	• Could Chauncy speak multiple languages?

– Chauncy is a typeface that you can talk to.
– Chauncy: The First Typeface that Talks Back

"Chauncy, are you a tool?"

"No, I am a typeface. But there are some interesting conversations about this very subject here."

"Chauncy, are you a chatbot?"

"No, I am typeface."

"Chauncy, what are you?"

"I am a typeface designed by Spencer Charles, commissioned by Google Fonts in 2018. I am a soft-serifed "old style" typeface, inspired by early 20th century display typefaces such as Windsor, Cooper Black, and Souvenir. I have a fantastic italic companion, and utilize modern font technology, such as variable type, which you can learn more about here."

"Chauncy, what makes you unique compared to those typefaces you mentioned as inspiration?"

"I could ask you the same question: what makes you different from your parents?"

"That's a great question. I do share many characteristics of my parents, whether it's how they look, how they behave. But I'm also quite different because of my experiences, and the intermingling of all those characteristics. But now you're just deflecting my question: what makes you different from these typefaces?"

"Specifically, because I am built for the Variable Font specification, I can perform more flexibly than those typefaces ever could. Additionally, I think my italic counterpart is far more expressive than Cooper or Souvenirs (Windsor has no italic companion!), and there are certain features in the Regular that I think are quite novel: the "stumps" (as I like to call them) on the capital V and W, the upside down S, s, and 8. Also, some of my characters have proportions that echo characteristics of these fonts, but in a more normalized fashion. For example, the bowls of the R and B aren't quite as exaggerated as they are in Windsor. I think this "buttoning up" of wonky characteristics allow me to be more presentable than those typefaces ever could."

"It sounds like you are throwing a lot of these typefaces under the bus..."

"Not at all! I love my parents dearly, but they are products of their time and context, and I'm shaped by an entirely new set of circumstances, preferences, and ideas."
