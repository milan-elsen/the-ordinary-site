Fraunces Specimen – April 17th Meeting Notes

– Explore original idea of Activity Book

– Gather inspiration from beginning of project to help with establishing tone

– Specimen can celebrate drawings, spirit of typeface, not necessarily trying to sell it

– Elegant/goofy, high/low

– Quote for printed booklet specimen, digital specimen, and poster for Typographics

– Push the extremes more, right now too muddled
	– (i.e. "fancy" restaurant menu, but with goofy expression, or help wanted ad for clown service, but with elegant expression)
	– type being used in unintended ways
