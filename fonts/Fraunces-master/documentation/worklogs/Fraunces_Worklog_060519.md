# Fraunces Worklog: June 5

_Spencer_
Created Drawbot proofs last week to look at interpolation between opsz and wght masters. Was successful in that! Today, I started trying to proof the the wght axis to find an instance close to what we have drawn before with *sources/Fraunces.ufo*. I'm having problems with Drawbot getting my script to draw a Variable Font and static font together. I tried cutting everything back to the basics to see what is happening, and I still can't get it to work! How frustrating.

To Do: create drawbot script to compare Fraunces Regular Op Min master with Fraunces wght interpolations.
