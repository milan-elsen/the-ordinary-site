# Fraunces Production Notes – July 15th – Spencer

Today, I've been working on generate VF files to test the Roman and Italic against each other. I've successfully build both files, but DrawBot seems to be having a problem recognizing the fonts. I have them both in a folder, with unique names, and the family name for each should be "Fraunces" and "Fraunces Italic" respectively.

When I point Drawbot to one of the font files, it will only load one of them for that session. I quit out and try pointing to the other file, which it does, but then it can't seem to load the other once one has already been loaded. I think something is going on with the Unique Name in the font info. When I look at both fonts in Font Book, their Unique Name's are exactly the same... I'm not sure why or how this is happening, and seems to be a problem to deal with.
