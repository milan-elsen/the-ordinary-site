# Fraunces Worklog - September 20th - Spencer

## Goofy Axis

I rebuilt the goofy axis as a test with Andy's updated script. Working great! Ran into a few small problems, I'll send him the fixes tomorrow.

## Vertical Metrics

I started raising all the ascenders to the ascender height we had set previously, but realized there are a couple of unresolved questions:

– Should the ascender to descender value be smaller than the em square? I looked at Amstelvar, and they gave an allowance 20 units (1980). Maybe I should look at more 2000upm fonts for ideas.

– What should the difference between Cap and Ascender be? I think if we use the currently smaller cap height, it gives us more room to overshoot the ascenders in the GoofyMax OpMin.
