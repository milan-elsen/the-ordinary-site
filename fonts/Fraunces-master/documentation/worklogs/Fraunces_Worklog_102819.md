## Extended Character Set

Flavia and I have been hard at work drawing all drawn glyphs (non-combining glyphs) for the Optical Min. Today, I filled out all Roman and Italic, and prepolated all characters. I'm going to spend the rest of the day setting up proof docs to look at text with these characters.

## Alternates for Accented Characters

It occurred to me a while ago that in order to have the WONK substitutions work, we would need to create alternates for all combining glyphs that have a base character of h/n/m/s. We'll need to revise the glyph construction script to include this.
