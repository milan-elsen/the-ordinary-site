# Fraunces Production Notes – July 17th – Spencer

I spent the day writing proofing scripts to look at weight, spacing, x-height and overshoot consistency across instances. 

This script "xheight_overshoot_check.py" will be a good starting point for proofing longer strings/paragraphs of text across instances, comparing roman with italic.

Here are my notes about changes that need to be made:

– tracking in op min black might need a bit more breathing room
– opmax black italic should be a bit lighter, weight taken out of interior/exterior depending on letterform
– ear in opmin black try to follow suit with expression of other masters
– x-height in opmin light a little tall
