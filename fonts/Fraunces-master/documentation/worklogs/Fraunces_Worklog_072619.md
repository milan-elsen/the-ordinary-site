# Fraunces Production Notes – July 26th – Spencer

## Proofing Changes

Spent the week drawing lowercase characters for all the Italic masters, to get the Italic caught up with where Flavia is at on the Roman. She's been working on drawings for the Roman uppercase, except for today when she started on the Italic uppercase. This has freed me up to work on writing some proofing scripts.

I wrote two scripts, one for looking at paragraphs of text at different sizes/optical sizes, across a range of weights. I also wrote a script for looking at spacing strings of all masters. These will be very handy moving forward. Previously, we were setting text in InDesign, which took up sooo much time. This has become impossible now that we need to proof this as a Variable Font. Moving forward, all I will need to do is update the VF font files, update the text files that feed into the scripts, and then run them again. :D

I also created bumper stickers yesterday that say "Honk for Wonky Fonts", which I'm excited to share at this years TypeCon. 

## Next Steps

That's it! I think by the end of next week, we'll have the test word "HAMBURGEFONTSIV hamburgefontsiv" drawn for all masters, and will also interpolate our Goofy/Formal masters to see how that Expression axis will behave. We might be ready to show that work by the end of next week, depending on how much progress I make on the Italic caps next week. 

We also have a lot of other changes we will need to synchronize. I am keeping a running .md file at sources/designspace_explorations/running_changes.md of everything we eventually need to get to. Flavia and I will keep adding to that file as changes come up, so we can stay synchronized on what needs to be done.
