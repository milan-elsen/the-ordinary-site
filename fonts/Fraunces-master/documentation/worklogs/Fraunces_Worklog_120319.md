# Fraunces Worklog - December 3rd - Spencer

## Status Report

Wow, been a bit too long since my last worklog!

We've been hard at work on the remainder of the character set for Fraunces. Here is a summary of what everyone is working on at the moment:

### Flavia (Accents & Diacritics)

Flavia has been refining the character set, focusing on the glyph construction files, setting up anchors and guides for building the extended language support. She will be working on the remainder of the Roman tomorrow & Friday, and start working on the Italic the week after. 

### Ethan (Corrections to Goofy Axis)

Ethan has been working on refining the recipes for the Goofy Max interpolations, and began corrections last weekend. Hopefully by the time he gets to the accented characters, we will have .glyphconstruction files to hand off to him so he can quickly build all of that.

### Benedikt @ Alphabet (Mastering)

Benedikt has done his initial review of the .designspace files. The biggest problems right now are coming up with a system for instance naming, and figuring out the axis ordering.

### Spencer

WooOoooO! What haven't I been working on? :P I've been splitting my time between quite a few fronts:

* Designed the look & feel/wireframe for the digital specimen. Will be meeting with everyone on Thursday to review the latest build of the minisite.
* Working with Andy Sturdevant to refine the text for the digital/print specimen. Waiting for feedback from the Google team.
* Worked a bit on the print specimen, getting a more accurate quote for the Riso printing. I would say the design is about 80% there. Just need to refine content, and polish certain pages.
* Working with Alphabet to begin the mastering process. Benedikt opened an issue on the repo with questions about instance naming.
* Been working on all drawn glyphs for the Italic OpMax Light & Black, so that is in good shape for Flavia to start looking at next week.

### To-Do

#### Font

* Accented & Combining Characters for Italic Goofy Min
* Corrections and Extended Character Set for all Goofy Max masters
* Kerning all Masters, would be good to start by setting up groups (most likely Flavia or Ethan will work on this when the time comes)

#### Mastering

* Instance naming (get feedback from Dave!!)
* Pass fontbakery checks

#### Writing

* Axis explanations on Git repo
* Feedback from Google
* Final draft of essay

#### Digital Specimen

* Character set overview
* OpSz diagram
* Stickers and header

#### Print Specimen

* Final quote
* Finalize copy
* Finish design
