# Fraunces Worklog: May 24th

_Flavia_
I started working on the new Light Opt Min that Spencer set the parameters earlier this week. We decided it would be wise to draw a test word across all masters (extremes) *hamburgefonstiv*, than interpolate and compare the glyphs side by side to check weight/ proportions/ spacing/ spirit of the design.

So far, I edited some of the characters drawn by Spencer â€” because we realized the x-height, ascender and descender values were wrong (we need to check this across the board and define vertical metrics before moving on), and added a few more including "normalized" alts for h, m, n. I also re-spaced everything, but it might be too tight.

Glyphs marked in green are my first pass. Yellow, Spencer's. Blue needs to be drawn.
